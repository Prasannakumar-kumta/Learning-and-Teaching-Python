#A Simple Game
'''Object orientation is very useful when managing different objects and their
relations. That is especially useful when you are developing games with
different characters and features.
Let's look at an example project that shows how classes are used in game development.
The game to be developed is an old fashioned text-based adventure game.
Below is the function handling input and simple parsing.'''

def get_input():
  command = input(": ").split()
  verb_word = command[0]
  if verb_word in verb_dict:
    verb = verb_dict[verb_word]
  else:
    print("Unknown verb {}". format(verb_word))
    return

  if len(command) >= 2:
    noun_word = command[1]
    print (verb(noun_word))
  else:
    print(verb("nothing"))

def say(noun):
  return 'You said "{}"'.format(noun)

verb_dict = {
  "say": say,
}

while True:
  get_input()


'''The code above takes input from the user, and tries to match the first word with
 a command in verb_dict.
 If a match is found, the corresponding function is called.'''

----------------------------------------------------------------

'''The next step is to use classes to represent game objects.'''
class GameObject:
  class_name = ""
  desc = ""
  objects = {}

  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
    GameObject.objects[self.class_name] = self

  def get_desc(self):
    return self.class_name + "\n" + self.desc

class Goblin(GameObject):
  class_name = "goblin"
  desc = "A foul creature"

goblin = Goblin("Gobbly")

def examine(noun):
  if noun in GameObject.objects:
    return GameObject.objects[noun].get_desc()
  else:
    return "There is no {} here.".format(noun)

''''We created a Goblin class, which inherits from the GameObjects class.
We also created a new function examine, which returns the objects description.
Now we can add a new "examine" verb to our dictionary and try it out!''''
verb_dict = {
  "say": say,
  "examine": examine,
}

Combine this code with the one in our previous example, and run the program.
